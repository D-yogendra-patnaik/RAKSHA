## 🚀 Quick Start (Local)

### 🔁 Backend (Flask)
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
The API will start on http://localhost:5000

💻 Frontend (React)
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
The app will open at http://localhost:3000

🤖 LLM Integration (AI Mentor)
To enable dynamic AI feedback:

Copy the .env.example file to .env:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Add your OpenAI API Key:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
ℹ️ If no key is set, fallback mentor responses will be used from the simulation file.

🐳 Run with Docker (Optional)
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Access the frontend at: http://localhost:3000

📚 How It Works
User selects age group and starts a simulation.

Interacts with a realistic scenario (email/SMS/voice trap).

AI mentor explains red flags based on action taken.

Progress is tracked, scored, and visualized.

🛡️ Disclaimer
This is a demo proof-of-concept. All content is synthetic and designed for educational simulation only. Do not input real personal information.

🧩 Contribute or Extend
Add new simulation scenarios in backend/simulations.json

Extend feedback logic with custom prompts or local models

Deploy for NGO, university, or cyber-literacy campaigns

🛡️ RAKSHA — AI-Powered Cybersecurity Simulation Trainer
RAKSHA is a proof-of-concept, open-source platform that trains users to recognize and respond to digital threats using realistic, gamified simulations and explainable AI coaching. It is designed to be privacy-respecting, age-aware, and easy to extend.

🔥 Highlights
Realistic simulations: phishing emails, SMS/OTP scams, honey-trap chat scenarios.

AI Mentor: concise, user-friendly feedback generated by an LLM (configurable).

Gamified UX: scoring, levels, and progress tracking to encourage repeated practice.

Age-aware scenarios: filter or select missions tailored for seniors, young adults, etc.

Privacy-first: sandboxed, synthetic content; no real PII required.

Full-stack demo: React frontend + Flask backend + optional Docker deployment.

⚙️ Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+) and npm (for frontend)

Python 3.9+ and pip (for backend)

Optional: Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized run)

Optional: OpenAI API key (for LLM-driven mentor feedback)

🚀 Quick start — Local (developer)
1) Backend (Flask)
bash
Copy code
# from project root
cd backend

# create and activate venv (Unix/macOS)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# on Windows (PowerShell)
# python -m venv venv
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
The backend will run on: http://localhost:5000
Available endpoints (examples):

GET /api/simulations?age_group=all|seniors|young — list simulations

GET /api/simulation/<id> — single simulation

POST /api/submit_response — submit user action, receive feedback and score update

GET /api/progress?user=<username> — retrieve user progress

2) Frontend (React)
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Open the UI at: http://localhost:3000 (it calls the backend at http://localhost:5000 by default).

🐳 Quick start — Docker (recommended for demo)
Build and run both services:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:5000

🤖 LLM / AI Mentor integration
RAKSHA includes a helper (backend/llm_helper.py) to call an LLM (example: OpenAI). The project will use static mentor messages in simulations.json if an API key is not configured.

Enable OpenAI (example)
Copy .env.example to .env at the project root.

Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
Install the backend dependencies (already includes openai and python-dotenv).

Run the backend — the server will use the LLM to generate concise feedback when available.

Security note: Never commit .env with production keys. Use secrets management in production.

🧩 Adding or editing simulations
Simulations live in backend/simulations.json. Each entry contains:

id — unique string

type — e.g., phishing_email, sms_otp, honey_trap_chat

title, difficulty, age_groups (array)

scenario — the message content (synthetic only)

red_flags — list of clues users should learn to identify

user_actions — available choices in the UI

correct_action — canonical correct choice

mentor_feedback — correct and incorrect fallback texts

Add new simulations following the existing JSON structure. Keep content synthetic (no real brand names or PII).

✅ Demo flow (what to show judges)
Open homepage → select age group (Seniors / Young / All).

Start a mission (e.g., “Health Card Renewal Alert”).

Choose an action (Flag / Reply / Open Link / Ask Mentor).

Receive immediate AI Mentor feedback and score update.

Show progress dashboard and level-up behavior.

A 60–90s recorded screencast or live demo is ideal.

🔒 Privacy & Safety
All demo scenarios are synthetic and sandboxed. Do not include real user PII in simulations.

Default demo: no persistent personally identifying data is exported.

If enabling LLM cloud calls, mask or avoid sending real sensitive data to third-party APIs.

For production: add HTTPS, authentication, rate-limiting, secure secret storage, and logging policies that redact sensitive fields.

🧪 Testing
Unit-tests are not included in the PoC; for production projects add tests for:

API endpoints (Flask tests)

Frontend components (React testing-library / Jest)

Prompt/output sanitization for LLM calls

♻️ Extending and productionizing
Ideas for next steps:

Replace static mentor text with refined LLM prompts and context windows.

Add user accounts, secure login, and server-side RBAC.

Integrate on-device heuristics or browser extension for real-time alerts (privacy-first).

Add analytics dashboards for organizations (NGOs, schools) to track effectiveness.

Replace SQLite with Postgres and add CI/CD pipelines.

🤝 Contributing

Contributions welcome! A simple guideline:

Fork the repo and create a feature branch.

Add tests for new functionality.

Open a pull request with a clear description of changes.

Keep simulations synthetic and ethically safe.
